## Milestone Project 4

* This project was built to showcase my abilites in designing and developing a full-stack web application using the django web framework, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

* The website I have built is a full stack ecommerce web application for a fictional fitness and weight company which I have called Fit as a Fiddle. I took inspiration from a multitude of places for this project from various fitness supplies companies, weights distributors and even other e-commerce stores like MandMdirect.

* The application I have developed uses E-commerce functionality, payments are made using Stripe, a blog section for store owners to use to create SEO friendly blog posts to increase  organic traffic to the site and a comments section for users to add comments for interactivity with the store and leave comments on blog posts, Only registered users can leave comments and leave reviews, review section so that users can voice their own opinion on specific products, Confirmation emails, CRUD functionality for admin users to add, update and delete products reviews and blog posts, comments, CRUD functionality for users to create read update and delete their own reviews in the reviews section and the ability to delete comments they have left on blog posts, admin have authorisation to do anything on the site.

* For the assessor, the admin login details have been included in the comments section when submitting the project.

* Please note that this website is solely for educational purposes so Please don't attempt to enter real credit card details when using the stripe functionality. use the below details for testing purposes.

## Strategy

* I created this site as a way for people who have an interest in all things fitness related to go and for fit as a fiddle to be a one stop shop for all things fitness related, from workout clothes, to weights to cardio equipment and workout plans, I also wanted to implelement a social aspect to the site which I believe was achieved through the use of comments being available on posts for logged in users and through the use of reviews on each of the individual product pages which shows an element of trust in the users and allows them to voice there opinion.
I set up a blog page for the site so that selected admin users can contribute articles to the site that are SEO friendly and lead to more organic traffic to the site and lead to increased revenue.
Admin users get the power to create update and delete everything on the site while users of the site get the power to add edit and delete the reviews they have left for various products and to delete their own comments on blog posts.
