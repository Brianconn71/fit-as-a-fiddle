# Testing

### Testing was required as part of MS4

#### Responsive Testing

In testing my site for mobile responsiveness I was constantly checking the site using Chrome Dev Tools on the various screen resolutions on offer. I aimed to make the site responsive down as far  as a 280px screen which was achieved through the use of media queries.

friends and family members also tested the site out on their relevant devices and it all worked as expected.

Please see below for a list of all screen sizes that my site was found to be mobile responsive on:
